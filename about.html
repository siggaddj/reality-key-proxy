	<h1>Project Reality Key</h1>
	<p>Project Reality Key is a project I decided to do just to test my ability to work with HTML. <br> The sites are very basic due to my knowledge of HTML and a small bit of CSS. <br>Project Reality Key was built to help share proxies with people who struggle to get new proxies or people that are banned from <a href="https://discord.gg/y576t4Yhbk" target="_blank">TN.</a><br>It is quite hard for me to get proxies, due to <a href="https://discord.gg/y576t4Yhbk" target="_blank">TN</a> limit everyone 3 proxies per month. I require help around in discord or other services to help make this list larger.</p>
